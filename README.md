COMP61332 Text Mining Coursework Report: Relation Extraction


We present two different RE approaches to Few-Shot Relation Classification Dataset (FewRel), consisting of 70, 000 sentences on 100 relations derived from Wikipedia and annotated by crowdworkers. The relation of each sentence is first recognized by distant supervision methods, and then filtered by crowdworkers. The goal is not to beat the state-of-the-art performance reported in the original work but to experiment with different approaches such as deep learning approaches with and without transformers and compare the performance of those approaches on  the evaluation dataset. Furthermore, the work continues to analyse based on the results obtained along with the strengths and weaknesses of  the approaches. The two models used in this RE approach are BERT and LSTM. The BERT-MERT model records an accuracy of 50% for 5 way 1 shot and 49.45% for 5 way 5 shot. The LSTM model records an accuracy of 81.64%.
